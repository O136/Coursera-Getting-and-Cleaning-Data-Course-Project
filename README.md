All data ressources are downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

codebook.md describes the variables, and any alterations that was done to clean up the downloaded data.

run_analysis.R contains the implemented requirements from
https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project
described in the 5 steps.

The output of the 5th step is in tidy_data.txt, which was not uploaded to the current repository because nothing was mentioned about it 
in the course requirements.
